/***README***/

Need to know:
	-The C version of the project is compiled under linux and uses libraries specific to it.



What did we defend:

Java & C
-Integer Overflow
-Buffer Overflow

-Improper or potentially hazardous user input.
	-Crashing
	-Scrubbing Strings
	-Scrubbing Filenames
	-Verifying and Encrypting Passwords

Shortcomings:

The C version is incomplete, it protects against overflow and inproper user input, but is missing password encryption/verification, and file output.
